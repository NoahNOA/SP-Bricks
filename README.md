# SP-Bricks
A little brick-breaking Arduino sketch using three 8x32 WS2812 flexible LED panels and a VL53L0X sensor.

Follow best practices as described in the Adafruit Neopixel Ubderguide.

All kinds of dependent on Adafruit libraries. (Xie xie, Lady Ada and friends!)

BTW: It isn't lost on me that undercutting the company on whose libraries our demo is built definitely constitutes biting the hand that feeds. Let's just say that Smart Prototyping is new to the legit Open Hardware game, and our intention is to make worthy hardware contributions for which we will write worthy driver code. We've got the in-house talent in the form of our for-hire R&D Team and we have a great SCM (supply chain management) Team. But on the retail side have lacked direction, hands-on familiarity with Open Hardware and the ability to spot and address unmet needs of Makers.

Change is imminent. Expect us... no wait, that sounds way too ominous! We can't wait to show you what we've got. :D
